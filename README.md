# SpringBoard: Editor for Spring

[Documentation](https://springboard-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installing

The simplest way to download SpringBoard is by using one of the provided installers:
- [Windows build](https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/releases/download/v1.1335.0/SpringBoard-1.1335.0.exe)
- [Linux build ](https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/releases/download/v1.1335.0/SpringBoard-1.1335.0.AppImage)

See [detailed instructions](https://springboard-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)

### Game-specific modules
This is the core module, you may still want to get additional game-specific modules if you're making a scenario.

Some examples:
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-BA
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-ZK
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-EVO
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-S44

## Assets

All assets (texture files, skyboxes, etc.) should be placed in the `springboard/assets` folder, located inside the Spring data directory.

A set of core assets are available. You can download them either via the launcher's `Asset Download` option (recommended), or manually via a [direct link](https://content.spring-launcher.com/core_v1.zip). In case of a manual download, you need to extract them to `springboard/assets/core/`.
