SpringBoard: Editor for Spring
==============================

SpringBoard is an in-game editor for the `SpringRTS <https://springrts.com/>`_ engine, and it can be used to develop maps and scenarios.

Installing
----------

The simplest way to download SpringBoard is by using one of the provided installers:

- `Windows build <https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/releases/download/v1.1335.0/SpringBoard-1.1335.0.exe>`_

- `Linux build <https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/releases/download/v1.1335.0/SpringBoard-1.1335.0.AppImage>`_

For details refer to :ref:`installing`.

Game-specific modules
---------------------
This is the core module, you may still want to get additional game-specific modules if you're making a scenario.

Some examples:

- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-BA
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-ZK
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-EVO
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-S44

Assets
------

A set of core assets are available. You can download them either via the launcher's ``Asset Download`` option (recommended), or manually via a `direct link <https://content.spring-launcher.com/core_v1.zip>`_. In case of a manual download, you need to extract them to ``springboard/assets/core/``.
